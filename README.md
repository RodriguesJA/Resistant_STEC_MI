#Descrition: 
This repository contains the scripts used for bioinformatics and gene extractions associated with Mukherjee et al., 2021 publication in [*Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy*](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.01189-21). 
Dr. Sanjana Mukherjee, Ph.D., M.Sc. led this work, a collaboration between the MDHHS and the [Manning Lab](https://manninglab.natsci.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University. 

#Data Availability: 
Sequences are available at BioProjects PRJNA596289, PRJNA514245, PRJNA218110 and PRJNA368991. 

#Key Features:
- Raw Data Management
- Genome Assembly and Annotation
- Comparative Genomics
- Antibiotic Resistance
- Gene extraction

#Bioinformatics Drawing: Please see the incredibly artistic flow chart below! Wow! This flowchart has a step-by-step breakdown of the bioinformatics pipeline, including the software used, inputs, outputs, and specific files for this publication.
